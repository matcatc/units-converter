The official documentation is contained in converter.docbook.

Updates:
- Project is no longer actively maintained. But you can still send me
  questions, bugs, etc. Its a simple project, so there's not really more to do,
  AFAIK.
- The documentation now has some broken links.
- Since I was just learning docbook back then, I wrote it in raw docbook. If I
  were to do it again (or work on the docs anymore), I'd redo it in asciidoc,
  which can generate docbook. And I would have it in this file, so we'd have
  only file with the documentation. Live and learn.
